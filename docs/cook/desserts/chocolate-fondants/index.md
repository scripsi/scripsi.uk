# Chocolate Fondants

Makes 4 (+1 spare)

## Ingredients

* 100 grams chocolate (70-80% cocoa solids)
* 100 grams butter (+ extra for coating ramekins)
* cocoa powder for dusting
* 4 eggs (2 eggs and 2 egg yolks)
* 100 grams sugar
* 100 grams plain flour

## Method

### Prepare the moulds

* Brush the insides of 5 ramekins with melted butter, using careful upward strokes around the sides to make sure they are completely coated
* Refrigerate the ramekins for 15-20 mins and then repeat brushing with melted butter, making sure there are no missed areas
* Refrigerate the ramekins again for 15-20 mins and then dust the inside of each one with __cocoa powder__

### Make the batter

* Melt the __butter__ and __chocolate__ in a small bowl and leave to cool slightly
* Separate 2 of the __eggs__, putting the yolks into a large bowl and discarding the whites (or use them in another recipe). Add the 2 remaining eggs (yolks _and_ whites) to the bowl together with the __sugar__ and whisk until pale and fluffy so that the whisk leaves a trail behind it.
* Add the chocolate/butter mixture and the __flour__ and beat together briefly until combined
* Pour the mixture into the prepared moulds and refrigerate for at least 2 hours

### Bake

* Bake for 12-14 mins at 180 C
* Gently wiggle the top of each fondant to loosen it from the sides of the ramekin and then tip out carefully onto a serving plate
