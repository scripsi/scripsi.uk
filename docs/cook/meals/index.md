# Meals

Complete meals.

The recipes in this section give suggested times to start each step, so, for example, if you want your meal to be ready at 7pm, then **T-50m** would mean "start this step at 6.10pm - T minus fifty minutes".

The ingredient quantities are for four people, and are usually only a rough guide. The tips after the recipe tell you how to scale the amounts up or down for more or fewer people (or for different hunger levels!)
