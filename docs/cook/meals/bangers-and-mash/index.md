# Bangers and Mash

Sausages, mashed potato, and peas, with onion gravy

## Ingredients

* 8-12 sausages
* 1 kg floury potatoes (Maris Piper, King Edward, Desiree or "All-rounder")
* 65 g butter
* 1 onion
* 1/2 beef OXO cube
* 2 tsp cornflour
* 200g frozen peas
* Salt
* Ground black pepper
* Milk
* Olive oil or cooking oil

## Method

* __T-60m__: Peel and chop the __potatoes__ into roughly 5cm chunks. Put the potatoes into a large saucepan, just covered with cold water. Bring to the boil and simmer for 15 minutes.
* __T-45m__: Peel the __onion__ and slice it thinly. Put it in a small saucepan with 15g of the __butter__ and leave to cook slowly over a low heat, stirring occasionally, until it is softened and well browned.
* __T-35m__: Turn on the oven to __200 C__
* __T-35m__: Test the potatoes by poking a sharp knife into them. If they split apart or fall back off the knife, then they are cooked. If they stay on the knife then they need a bit longer. When cooked, drain the potatoes and put them back into the pan. Put the pan back on the heat for a few seconds to sizzle off any remaining water, then turn off the heat and add the remaining 50g __butter__
* __T-30m__: Put the sausages in a roasting dish. Drizzle a little __olive oil or cooking oil__ over the sausages and turn them over to coat them. Put the sausages in the oven.
* __T-25m__: Mash the potatoes thoroughly. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and stir in a little milk to adjust the consistency. Transfer the mashed potato to a microwaveable bowl.
* __T-15m__: Take the sausages out of the oven and turn them over with a spatula or tongs. Return them to the oven.
* __T-15m__: By now, the onion should be well browned. Crumble in the __beef OXO__, and add the __cornflour__. Stir to coat the onion in the cornflour and then add about 250 ml water. Turn up the heat and bring to the boil, stirring continuously until the gravy thickens. Turn down the heat to a simmer and stir in plenty of black pepper.
* __T-5m__: Put the bowl of mashed potato in the microwave and cook on full power for 5 minutes.
* __T-5m__: Put the frozen peas into an empty saucepan and just cover with cold water. Put a lid on the pan and put on a high heat. Drain them in a sieve as soon as they come to the boil.
* __T-0m__: Serve
