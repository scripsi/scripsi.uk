    This recipe is adapted from [Felicity Cloake's Perfect Fishcakes](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/jun/16/how-to-cook-perfect-fishcakes). Make sure you leave enough time for the shaped mixture to cool in the fridge and firm up before you try to coat them. I find that the breadcrumbs tend to burn if I try to fry them until the cakes are cooked through. It is easier to bake them in the oven after frying them briefly.
