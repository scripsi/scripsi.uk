# Chocolate Cookies

Makes 12-15 cookies

## Ingredients

* 175 grams light brown soft sugar
* 75 grams butter
* 1 egg
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 100 grams plain flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 25 grams cocoa powder
* 125 grams dark chocolate
* 50 grams chocolate chips or chunks

## Method

* Cream together the __butter__ and __sugar__ in a large bowl
* Beat in the __egg__ and __vanilla extract__
* Add the __flour__, __baking powder__ and __cocoa powder__ and mix together
* Melt the __chocolate__ in a separate bowl and then add to the mixture to form a stiff dough
* Mix in the __chocolate chips__ and chill in the fridge for 15 minutes
* Divide up and form the mixture into 12-15 golf-ball sized lumps, and flatten each one into a 1cm thick disk with your hands

At this point, they can either be baked straight away or frozen for later use. To bake:

* Preheat the oven to 160C(fan)/180C(conventional)
* Lay out the cookies on non-stick baking paper on a baking tray, leaving plenty of space between them.
* Bake for 10-12 minutes (fresh) or 14-16 minutes (frozen)
* They will still be very soft when you take them out of the oven. __Allow to cool__ and harden for at least 5-10 mins before eating.
