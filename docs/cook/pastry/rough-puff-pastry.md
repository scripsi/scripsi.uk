# Rough Puff Pastry

## Ingredients

* 200 grams plain flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 150 grams butter
* 1/2 lemon - juiced and made up to 125 grams with cold water

## Method

* Mix the __flour__ and with __salt__ in a bowl
* Cut up the cold __butter__ into the flour
* Add the __lemon juice and water__ and mix by cutting repeatedly through the mixture with a table knife until it comes together into a shaggy ball with small lumps of butter dotted through it.
* Tip the pastry onto a well floured worksurface and roll out into a rough rectangle about 1 cm thick. Fold the top third into the middle and then lift the bottom third over it. Seal the seams by pressing down the edges with the rolling pin
* Turn the pastry block 90 degrees clockwise and repeat the rolling and folding procedure once more. Rest in the fridge for 10-15 minutes.
* Repeat the rolling, folding and turning procedure twice more, this time rolling it out into a larger rectangle about 0.5 cm thick so that the lumps of butter begin to spread out and merge. Rest in the fridge for 10-15 minutes.
* Repeat the rolling, folding and turning procedure twice more, this time trying to keep the rectangle as straight and even as possible.
* The finished pastry block should look even, smooth and without lumps of butter breaking the surface. If it is not, then repeat the folding and resting process until it is.
* Cover the pastry with clingfilm and rest in the fridge for at least an hour before using.
