* 3/4 tsp salt
* 1 1/2 tsp dried instant yeast

## Method

* Separate the __eggs__, putting the whites into a separate bowl and adding the yolks to the flour
* Warm the __sour cream__ and __milk__ together until they are about at blood heat and then whisk into the flour to make a loose batter
* Cover and leave to rise for 1 hour
* Whisk the egg whites until stiff and carefully fold them into the batter
