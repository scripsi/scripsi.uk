# Naan

## Ingredients

* 400 grams strong bread flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 tsp dried instant yeast
* 150 grams natural yoghurt
* 150 grams warm water
* melted butter for brushing

## Method

* Mix the __flour__, __salt__, and __yeast__ together in a large bowl
* Add the __yoghurt__ and __warm water__, and mix together into a rough dough
* Prove for about 1 hour, folding every 15-20 mins to make a smooth, elastic and slightly sticky dough.
* Tip the proved dough out onto a lightly-floured worksurface and divide into quarters
* Form each quarter into a tight ball and leave to rest on the worksurface for 15-20 mins
* Heat a dry frying pan on a medium heat and put a baking tray in a low oven to keep the naans warm once you've cooked them.
* Take one of the balls of dough and either roll it or press it out with your fingers into a disk to fit the base of the pan. If you want a more traditional teardrop shape, then pull on an edge of the dough with finger and thumb while holding the opposite edge against the worksurface with the palm of your other hand.
* Lay the dough in the heated frying pan and wait until bubbles puff up on the top surface and the thinner areas start to look dry.
* Flip it over and cook until the raised bubbles become slightly flattened and charred
* Flip it over again and brush with a little melted __butter__ before removing from the pan and putting on the baking tray in the oven to keep warm
* Repeat the rolling and frying process with the other 3 balls of dough.
