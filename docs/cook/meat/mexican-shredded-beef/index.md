# Mexican shredded beef

## Ingredients

* 1 kilogram stewing beef (preferably in large pieces)
* Olive oil for frying

Spice mix

* 1 tablespoon fajita seasoning
* 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
* 1 tablespoon dried origano
* 1 teaspoon ground allspice
* 1 teaspoon ground coriander

## Method

* Combine the spice mix ingredients in a bowl
* Rub 4 teaspoons of the spice mix into the __beef__
* Heat a small amount of __oil__ in a large, heavy-based saucepan and brown the beef well on all sides before removing to a plate
* Turn down the heat, add a little more oil and fry the __onion__ and __garlic__ for a few minutes until soft
* Add the __orange juice__ and __lime juice__ and scrape the base of the pan to loosen any brown bits
* Add the __tomatoes__, __beef stock__, and the rest of the spice mix and stir before returning the beef to the pan
* If necessary, add a little water to help prevent sticking, and turn down the heat to a simmer
* Cook slowly with the lid on for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours until the meat is very tender
* Lift out the beef and shred with two forks
* Reduce the sauce on a high heat to thicken and then turn off the heat and blend with a stick-blender until smooth
* Add back the shredded beef and adjust the flavour with more fajita seasoning and salt if necessary

    This recipe is adapted from [https://recipetineats.com/mexican-shredded-beef-and-tacos](https://recipetineats.com/mexican-shredded-beef-and-tacos). Fajita seasoning is easier to get hold of in UK supermarkets than chipotle chilli powder and it works fine. This beef is great on tacos, with nachos and in enchiladas.
