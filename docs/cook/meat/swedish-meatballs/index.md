# Swedish Meatballs

Serves 4

## Ingredients

### Meatballs
* 100 ml milk
* 30 ml beer
* 5 tbsp porridge oats
* 2 eggs
* 500 g beef mince
* 1 small onion, finely chopped
* 0.5 tsp white pepper
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp dried thyme
* 20 g butter

### Sauce
* 1 tbsp flour
* 100 ml beer
* 100 ml beef stock
* 1 tsp soy sauce
* 150 ml single cream

## Method

### Meatballs
* In a large bowl, mix the **milk**, **beer**, and **porridge oats**, and leave to soak for 10 minutes
* Add the **eggs**, **beef mince**, **onion**, **white pepper**, **salt**, and **dried thyme**, and combine thoroughly to form a rather sloppy mixture
* Divide the mixture into tablespoon-sized portions and form into rough balls
* Heat the **butter** in a large frying pan over a medium heat, and carefully add the meatballs
* Fry for about 4-5 mins until browned underneath and then carefully turn them over. Put a lid on the pan and fry for another 4-5 mins until cooked through and browned on both sides
* Remove the meatballs from the pan and keep them warm while you make the sauce

### Sauce
* Stir the **flour** into the remaining pan juices and then add the **beer**, **beef stock** and **soy sauce**
* Boil and reduce the sauce slightly, while stirring constantly, then turn down the heat and stir in the **single cream**
* Once the sauce is warmed through, strain into a jug to serve

Serve the meatballs with the sauce, accompanied by mashed potato, green peas, and lingonberry, cranberry or blackcurrant jam
